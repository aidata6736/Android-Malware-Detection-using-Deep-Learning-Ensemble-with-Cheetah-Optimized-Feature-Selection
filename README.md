step 1 : 
    Data Collection: Gather a balanced dataset of benign and malicious Android app samples.

step 2 : 
    Feature Extraction
        (i) Statistical Features:
                ~ Central Tendency: Extract measures like mean, median, and mode to understand the central location of the data.
                ~ Spread: Calculate standard deviation, variance, interquartile range (IQR) to understand how spread out the                       data is.
                ~ Skewness and Kurtosis
        (ii) Flow based features: Flow Duration, and other flow-based features in database
       (iii) Packet based feature: in database
       
step 3 :
    Feature Selection: 
       Combination of Cheetah optimization algorithm and variable velocity strategy particle swarm optimization algorithm (VVS-PSO)

step 4 :
    Detection using DSDNN model:
        Combine multiple deep learning classifiers like Deep Siamese + DenseNet + NasNet Ensemble (DSDNN)
        
    Detection model:
      Base model:
    1. Input Layer
    2. Conv layer
    3. normal cell
    4. reduction cell
    5. normal cell
    6. Dense Block
    7. Average pooling 
    8. Flattening
    9. Dense 
    -------------------------------------------------
    
    
    DSDNN ( Whole Network)
    
    1. Give input a and b to the Base model
    2. Calculate the Euclidean distance
    3. Softmax
    4. similarity
