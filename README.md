step 1 : 
    Data Collection: Gather a balanced dataset of benign and malicious Android app samples.
    Dataset link:

step 2 : 
    Feature Extraction
        (i) Statistical Features:
                ~ Central Tendency: Extract measures like mean, median, and mode to understand the central location of the data.
                ~ Spread: Calculate standard deviation, variance, interquartile range (IQR) to understand how spread out the                       data is.
                ~ Skewness and Kurtosis
        (ii) Flow based features: Flow Duration, and other flow-based features in database
       (iii) Packet based feature: in database

step 3:
    The extracted features are splits for training and testing. Splited train test values are saved in pickle format for future uses.
    Three different learning rates for training and testing is,
        (i) 60 % for training and 40 % for testing
        (ii) 70 % for training and 30 % for testing
        (iii) 80 % for training and 20 % for testing
       
step 4 :
    Feature Selection: 
       Combination of Cheetah optimization algorithm and variable velocity strategy particle swarm optimization algorithm (VVS-PSO)

step 5 :
    Detection using DSDNN model:
        Combine multiple deep learning classifiers like Deep Siamese + DenseNet + NasNet Ensemble (DSDNN)
        
    Detection model:
      Base model:
    1. Input Layer
    2. Conv layer
    3. normal cell
    4. reduction cell
    5. normal cell
    6. Dense Block
    7. Average pooling 
    8. Flattening
    9. Dense 
    -------------------------------------------------
    
    
    DSDNN ( Whole Network)
    
    1. Give input a and b to the Base model
    2. Calculate the Euclidean distance
    3. Softmax
    4. similarity
